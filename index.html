            <h2>The Life of Nikola Tesla</h2>           
          <p>Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia. His mother was an inventor and his father was a priest. His parents wanted him to become a priest like his father, but he had a passion for studying Science. He became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor. He studied Science at the University of Prague and then started working for the Central Telephone Exchange in Budapest. After that Tesla got another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company where he worked with electric power utility.At the age of 28, Tesla decided to go to America in pursuit of his desire to create new inventions. Upon moving to the United States, Tesla started working with the famous American inventor, Thomas Edison. While working together, a disagreement occurred between Tesla and Edison over Edison's direct current and Tesla's alternating current. This was also known as the “war of the currents”. Edison lamps were supplied with direct current which made them weak and inefficient. The direct current could not travel for long distances. On the other hand, Tesla's alternating current was able to travel long distances on distribution lines, first in one direction, and then in another in multiple waves.The money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue his own interests.</p>

          <h2>Death and Legacy</h2>
          <p>You would be surprised to know that Tesla had over 800 different patents to his name, and despite that he was penniless. Ridicule from his own colleagues, lack of recognition by the public, drove him into a life of depression and self-imposed exile. He started jotting down his theories and research activities in his diaries and notebooks instead of getting them published anywhere. Poor and reclusive, Nikola Tesla died on January 7, 1943, at the age of 86, in New York City where he had lived for nearly 60 years. His legacy, however, has been thriving for more than a century, and will undoubtedly live on for decades to come.Several books and films have highlighted Tesla's life and famous works.Half a century after his death, scientists are still trying to comprehend and study his various theories. Many of them are just now being proven. It is indeed sad that we never managed to recognize and appreciate a true genius like Tesla in his lifetime.</p>
